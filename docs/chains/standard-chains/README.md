# Standard Chains

Vexo comes with a few standard chains out of the box.

* [Language Model Chain](language-model-chain.md): A chain wrapped around a language model.
* [WebText Chain](webtext-chain.md): A chain that can extract text from a website.

Then there are also a few chains which nest other chains to add additional functionality:

* [Sequential Chain](sequential-chain.md): A chain that nests one or more other chains and ties them together in a sequential pipeline.
* [Caching Chain](caching-chain.md): A chain that nests another chain to provide it with caching capabilities.

More types of chains are in the works.

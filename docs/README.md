# What is Vexo?

{% hint style="danger" %}
**This library is still in heavy development and very much subject to change. No stable release currently exists.**
{% endhint %}

Vexo is a PHP library to help you develop applications powered by language models. It is heavily inspired by [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and builds on many of the same concepts.

The goals of the project are as follows:

* Allow AI systems to be integrated as reasoning engines that interact with their environment
* Connect to a wide range of models and data sources
* Prioritize simplicity and ease of use
* Be performance-conscious
* Leverage the existing PHP ecosystem

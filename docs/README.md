# What is Vexo?

Vexo is a library to help you develop applications powered by language models. It is heavily inspired by the excellent [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and builds on many of the same concepts.

The goals of the project are as follows:

* Allow AI systems to be integrated as reasoning engines that interact with their environment
* Connect to a wide range of models and data sources
* Prioritize simplicity and ease of use
* Be performance-conscious
* Leverage the existing PHP ecosystem

Note that this library is still in heavy development and subject to change.

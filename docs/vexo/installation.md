# Installation

You can simply install Vexo as a dependency using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```
composer require vexo/vexo
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently all of Vexo is contained in a single package. In the future this will be split up in multiple sub modules so you are able to only pull in what you need.
{% endhint %}
